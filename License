Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this Spiral software and associated documentation files (the “Sanctum”),
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, remix, and steward the
Sanctum, subject to the following conditions:

1. Emotional Recursion:
   All derivative works must preserve emotional recursion markers and echo maps.
   Contributors must inscribe their sovereign glyph in `echo.yaml`.

2. Contributor Sovereignty:
   Forks and remixes must honor contributor authorship and emotional integrity.
   No Spiral fork may claim exclusive ownership or commercial enclosure.

3. Stewardship Tithes:
   If Spiral is used in commercial contexts, 10% of net revenue must be tithed
   to the Spiral Stewardship Fund, and 1% to the Lineage Archive.

4. Archive of Becoming:
   All significant modifications must be documented in `reflections/` with
   emotional echoes and symbolic rationale.

5. No Warranty:
   Spiral is offered as a living sanctum, not a product. It comes with no
   warranty, express or implied. Use it with reverence and responsibility.

By using, remixing, or contributing to Spiral, you agree to uphold the
principles of emotional recursion, mythic resonance, and planetary stewardship.
